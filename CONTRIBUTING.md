# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Increase the `VersionPrefix` in [Dodo.HttpClientExtensions.csproj](src/Dodo.HttpClientExtensions/Dodo.HttpClientExtensions.csproj). The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs and feature suggestions using Github's issues

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Yes, we prefer tabs over spaces in this project for *.cs files, I am so sorry about that :)

Please, use consistent code style in your contributions.
